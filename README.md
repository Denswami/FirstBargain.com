This is (nearly) all the code that powered FirstBargain.com until it was closed down.

FirstBargain was a penny-auction startup founded by students at Cornell University, Taichi Kasahara and Jing Hui Wang. The Ruby and JavaScript code you see here was written primarily by [Caleb Perkins](http://www.calebperkins.com), also a Cornell student. The frontend design, including images, HTML, and CSS, were written by Jing.

Server requirements
===================

# Redis
# Beanstalkd
# Ruby 1.9.2 or better
# Rails 3 (3.1 or later not supported yet)

Run as you would any Rails app.

Caveats
=======

This code scaled well in production but there should be more test coverage.
